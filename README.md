This is a **poorly hacked** version of StoreBackup to make it use reflink copys instead of real copies, its not advisable to use it!

If you want to use StoreBackup consider using the release from the official [Project Website](http://storebackup.org/) instead of my hacked one.

The official documentation of StoreBackup ist available [here](http://www.nongnu.org/storebackup/).

The purpose of my changes was to provide an snapshot like feature for XFS Users.

StoreBackup is licensed under the terms of the GPL-v3 or any later version.
